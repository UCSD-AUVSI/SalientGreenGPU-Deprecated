To build Salient Green, execute the following commands from the command line
(on linux)

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

This creates the executable "SalientGreen" which will process one image passed
to it by the command line

Salient Green requires C++0x support to build as well as OpenCV 2.2 or later.

It has only been tested under linux but should also build without issue
on Windows based systems using a similar procedure with cmake to create
relevant project files for MSVC.
